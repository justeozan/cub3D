# Cub3D

Cub3D is a 3D game engine project inspired by the classic Wolfenstein 3D. Developed as part of the 42 curriculum, this project focuses on building a basic 3D game engine from scratch using the C programming language.

## Features

- **Ray-Casting Engine**: Utilizes ray-casting techniques to render a simple 3D environment.
- **Textures**: Support for basic texture mapping on walls.
- **Player Movement**: First-person player controls for exploring the environment.
- **Lighting**: Basic lighting effects to enhance the visual experience.
- **Minimalist Design**: Emphasis on efficient code and optimization, aligning with low-level programming principles.

## Requirements

- **Language**: C
- **Libraries**: MiniLibX for graphics rendering
- **Operating System**: Unix-based (Linux, macOS)

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cub3D.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd cub3D
    ```
3. Compile the project:
    ```bash
    make
    ```
4. Run the executable:
    ```bash
    ./cub3D [map_file]
    ```

## Usage

- Use the arrow keys or `WASD` to move around.
- Press `ESC` to exit the game.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains all source code files.
- `include/`: Header files.
- `maps/`: Example map files.
- `textures/`: Texture images used in the game.
